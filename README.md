# Goblin_Dodger
An old school style game with a fantasy twist. 
This is an endless wave shooter game where you play as a merc that was hired to protect a rich merchants caravan from one city to another. 
Along your travels you were raided by a goblinoid party and it is now your job to rush after them and get the stolen gold back.

Goblinoid enemies spawn at random in waves and each carry the same amount of gold, but they won't give it up that easily so it's up to you to dodge their volleies of arrows while sending your own flurry at them.
